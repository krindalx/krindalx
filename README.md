I study crypto and AI systems from an infrastructure-first perspective.

Focus areas:
- On-chain architecture & execution
- Agent economies and autonomous systems
- Solana and high-performance chains
- Cost, latency, and scaling constraints

I'm not building products here.
I'm mapping the systems they'll run on.
